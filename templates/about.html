        <h2>About Sentiment Analysis</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Our sentiment analysis website allows users to input text and compare
          the sentiment scores generated by two different methods: Google
          Sentiment Analysis API and the TextBlob library. Both methods offer
          unique approaches to sentiment analysis, which can be beneficial
          depending on the context and purpose of the analysis.

          <h3 class="mb-3">Google Sentiment Analysis API</h3>
          <p>
            The Google Sentiment Analysis API is a powerful tool that uses
            advanced natural language processing models to analyze text and
            determine its sentiment. It is based on Google's machine learning
            technology, which leverages deep learning techniques to understand
            and process human language. The API assigns a sentiment score
            between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates a strong negative sentiment, 1
            indicates a strong positive sentiment, and 0 represents a neutral
            sentiment.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key advantages of the Google Sentiment Analysis API is
            its ability to understand complex linguistic patterns and nuances,
            thanks to the underlying machine learning models. This allows the
            API to provide more accurate and context-aware sentiment scores for
            a wide range of text inputs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="mb-3">TextBlob Library</h3>
          <p>
            TextBlob is a popular Python library for processing textual data. It
            provides an easy-to-use interface for common text processing tasks,
            including sentiment analysis. TextBlob's sentiment analysis is
            primarily based on pattern matching and a predefined list of
            positive and negative words, which makes it simpler and more
            lightweight compared to Google's API.
          </p>
          <p>
            While TextBlob might not be as advanced as the Google Sentiment
            Analysis API, it can still be useful for quickly estimating the
            sentiment of text inputs, especially when dealing with smaller
            datasets or less complex language. Like the Google API, TextBlob
            assigns a sentiment score between -1 and 1 based on the input text.

      <h3 class="mb-3 mt-4">Comparing Sentiment Analysis Methods</h3>
      <p>
        By comparing the sentiment scores from both the Google Sentiment
        Analysis API and the TextBlob library, users can gain a better
        understanding of how different tools and algorithms interpret the
        sentiment of their text. This can be helpful in a variety of
        applications, such as analyzing social media content, customer reviews,
        or any other text-based data that contains opinions or emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding the differences between these two methods allows users to
        choose the best approach for their specific needs, whether they require
        the advanced language processing capabilities of Google's API or the
        simplicity and speed of TextBlob's library.
